**Repository Description:**

This repository contains two playbooks for setting up a LAMP stack. A LAMP stack is a popular web development environment that combines Linux as the operating system, Apache as the web server, MySQL as the database management system, and PHP as the server-side scripting language.

**Playbook 1: LAMP Stack Installation**
The first playbook is designed to automate the installation process of the LAMP stack on a Linux system. It performs the following tasks:

- Installs the necessary packages and dependencies for each component of the LAMP stack.
- Configures the Linux operating system to support Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
- Installs and configures the Apache web server, ensuring it is up and running.
- Sets up and secures the MySQL database server, including creating the necessary user accounts and configuring access privileges.
- Installs PHP and configures it to work with Apache and MySQL.

By running this playbook, you can quickly and efficiently set up a LAMP stack environment on a Linux system, providing a solid foundation for web development projects.

**Playbook 2: Web Application Deployment**
The second playbook focuses on deploying a web application within the LAMP stack. It assumes that the LAMP stack is already installed and configured. The playbook performs the following tasks:

- Copies the web application files to the appropriate directory on the server.
- Configures the Apache web server to serve the web application.
- Sets up the necessary virtual hosts and ensures proper routing and access to the application.
- Performs any additional configuration or setup specific to the web application, such as database connections or environment variables.

By running this playbook, you can automate the deployment process of your web application within the LAMP stack, saving time and ensuring consistency across different environments.

The provided playbooks demonstrate the power of automation using Ansible, a popular configuration management and orchestration tool. They simplify the process of setting up and deploying a LAMP stack, making it easier for developers to focus on their web application development rather than manual system configuration.
Feel free to customize the playbooks based on your specific requirements and extend them with additional tasks or configurations as needed.
